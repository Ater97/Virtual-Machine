When you run the program an open file dialog will display, so 
you can choose the folder with all the .vm files to convert into
one .asm file. The new file will be created inside of the folder
with the .vm files.

After this a new dialog will show, in case you want to inicialice
the .asm file, then another dialog will show, asking if you want to 
convert another file, if you do click YES and the file dialog will 
show again. In case you are done only click NO and the program will
close. 

Have a nice day... :)
